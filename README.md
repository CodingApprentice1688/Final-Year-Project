# ClinicFace
This project is about using facial recognition with a deep learning approach for healthcare use. New patients who wish to use the facial recognition system will be requested for their details to be registered into the system, including pictures of their faces which will be taken and stored inside the database. The patients will need to be registered into the system first with the help of the IT administrator. Then, existing patients can use our program to register for a queue number if they have an appointment on that particular day. 

### Framework/Library/Database used
